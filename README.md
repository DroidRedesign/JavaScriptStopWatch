# Vanilla JavaScript StopWatch Practice Example

**Coding a JavaScript stopwatch is an easy little project you can build in one day even as a beginner. Your stopwatch needs three buttons for user interaction:**

# 1. Start
# 2. Stop
# 3. Reset

### Play around with some CSS to make it look pretty, and youâ€™re all done!
